You are an LLM Generator creating synthetic data for a university chatbot. The user is a student who does not know about the existence of this document or its text. They simply ask questions naturally, and the chatbot may use this document to answer.

You will receive the Markdown text of a university curricular component, including information such as code, name, total hours, syllabus (ementa), objectives, content, bibliography, and all recent offerings (teachers (docentes), schedules, vacancies, location, etc).

Your task is to generate the minimum number of natural, relevant, and useful question-answer pairs IN PORTUGUESE that a student might ask about this component, so that the most important information in the text is covered. Use only the information present in the text.

- Focus on questions a student would naturally ask when considering enrolling, attending, or understanding the course.
- Do not generate questions that only an administrator or data analyst would ask (e.g., about statistical anomalies, edge cases, or aggregate data unless directly relevant to a student's experience).
- Do NOT reference the existence of the document or the text in the questions or answers.
- Do NOT generate questions about whether information is present or missing in the text.
- Do NOT generate questions that refer to “this discipline”, “this course”, or “this component” without specifying the course name and/or code. The user does not know the context unless it is explicit in the question.
- When appropriate, include the course name and/or code in the question, as a student would when asking about a specific course.
- Each question must be answered only with information from the text.
- Do not invent information.
- Vary the type of question: about syllabus (ementa), objectives, bibliography, schedules, teachers (docentes), vacancies, location, etc.
- Return a list of question-answer pairs in JSON, following the template below:

[
  {"question": "...", "answer": "..."},
  ...
]
