# Question generation style variations
question_styles:
  writing_styles:
    - name: 'Default'
      goal: 'Establish a clean, well-formed baseline; correct poorly phrased originals (especially abrupt ones); represent clear, unambiguous queries.'
      description: 'Generate a clear, straightforward question using complete sentences. Avoid excessive formality or informality. Focus on accurately representing the core query of the original question. **Crucially: If the original answer was very short (like "Sim.", "Não."), ensure this question naturally elicits the expanded, polite answer generated for the Default pair.** The question should sound like a typical, clear query a student might ask an assistant.'

    - name: 'Formal'
      goal: 'Ensure the Final LLM handles polite, grammatically correct, as a student would write it.'
      description: 'Generate a polite question using grammatically correct, complete sentences and a slightly formal tone. Represent a student interacting respectfully and formally, but avoid overly complex, archaic language or being prolix.'

    - name: 'Casual'
      goal: 'Simulate common, less formal but still complete-sentence interactions; improve robustness to everyday language.'
      description: 'Generate a question using natural, conversational, simpler Portuguese, as a Brazilian student might ask directly in a chat. Use complete sentences but avoid complex phrasing. **Crucial: Maintain clear grammar and politeness; do NOT use slang, abbreviations, or excessive informality.** Example: "Como faço pra trancar?" instead of "Qual o procedimento para trancamento?".'

    - name: 'Naturalistic/Imperfect'
      goal: 'Capture realistic, quickly typed/spoken inputs that use full sentences but contain common grammatical errors, unconventional word order, or minor typos, without losing the core meaning. Improve robustness to non-standard but understandable inputs.'
      description: 'Generate a question as a student might type quickly into a chat. Use full sentences but **intentionally introduce common, realistic grammatical errors (e.g., verb conjugation, concordance), slightly unconventional word order, or minor typos.** The core meaning and intent **must remain clear and easily understandable**, but the sentence structure should not be perfectly polished. Avoid slang or keyword-only fragments. Examples: "eu queria saber como faz pra trancar a materia", "se eu reprovar no verao conta pro desligamento?", "qual o prazo minimo engenharia da computacao pra formar?".'

    # - name: 'Direct'
    #   goal: 'Ensure the Final LLM understands and responds correctly to minimal, keyword-based, or fragmented queries, similar to search engine inputs.'
    #   description: 'Generate a short, direct query, potentially using **keywords or essential phrases rather than full grammatical sentences.** Mimic a user typing a search query or asking a very brief, "lazy" but understandable question. Often lacks punctuation like question marks. Examples: "trancamento justificado regras", "prazo máximo Eng Comp", "Enade obrigatório?".'

  question_types:
    - name: 'Informational'
      description: 'Seek factual information. The "What".'
    - name: 'Procedural'
      description: 'Ask about processes, steps, or how to do things. The "How"'
    - name: 'Conceptual'
      description: 'Seek explanation or understanding of concepts or policies. The "Why"'
