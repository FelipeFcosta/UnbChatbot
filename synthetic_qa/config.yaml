    - name: 'Casual'

    - name: 'Direct'
      description: 'Write a direct, search-like simple query/keywords-based lazy but understandable question (no question mark) seeking specific information.'
    - name: 'Confused_Indirect'

    - name: 'Incorrect Premise'
      description: "Question stems from a factually incorrect/WRONG premise or a common misunderstanding from a student. The user's query should implicitly treat this incorrect information as true, naturally prompting a corrective response from the assistant."
